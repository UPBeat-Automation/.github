# Xeren

**Xeren** is an open-source initiative focused on supporting the **Universal Powerline Bus (UPB)** community.  

UPB is still one of the most reliable home automation technologies, but when Leviton discontinued support for Omni/HAI controllers, many users were left stranded.  

We believe you shouldnâ€™t have to rip out working systems or throw away decades of investment just to stay modern.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Focus
- **Universal Powerline Bus (UPB) + Hubitat integration** â†’ We built [UPBeat-Hubitat](https://github.com/xeren-io/UPBeat-Hubitat), a free integration that lets you keep using your UPB switches and scenes in a modern Hubitat environment.  
- **Supporting legacy Omni/HAI users** â†’ Exploring ways to bridge old OmniPro setups into todayâ€™s modern platforms.  
- **Community-first** â†’ Xeren is not a company â€” itâ€™s a community-driven effort to keep UPB alive, reliable, and open.
