For those unfamiliar, UPB is a tried-and-true technology that uses your home's existing wiring to control lights, dimmers, switches, and more. No fancy hubs, repeaters, or radio waves needed - just simple, reliable communication through the very wires powering your house. 

However, I've also witnessed something disheartening: UPB often gets dismissed as outdated, overlooked in the rush for the latest wireless gadgets.  That's a shame, because UPB boasts an **impressive signal delivery efficacy rate** and requires **zero reliance on radio waves or repeaters**, a major plus for those concerned about radiation or signal interference.

That's why I'm thrilled to introduce **UPBeat**: a project dedicated to bringing UPB into the modern era. 

**UPBeat aims to:**

* **Bridge the gap:** Make UPB seamlessly integrate with today's smart home platforms and technologies, like Hubitat.
* **Empower the community:** Provide open-source tools and resources, fostering collaboration and innovation within the UPB user base.
* **Reignite the spark:** Showcase the unique strengths and potential of UPB, attracting new users and ensuring this reliable technology thrives for years to come.

This project is my love letter to the UPB community. It's my way of saying, "You're not forgotten! Let's work together to keep UPB shining bright!" âœ¨
